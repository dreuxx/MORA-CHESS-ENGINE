# MORA CHESS ENGINE

Being a software engineering student, I found myself struggling to come with an idea for my final project. I love to play chess and I love to code. So one day while I was reading about [AlphaZero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero) I started to wonder how difficult could it be to write my own chess engine. After a while I realized that, being challenging enough, writing a chess engine was a feasible project within 6 months. So I presented the idea to my project director and started to work.

The main goal was for my engine to reach 2000 ELO in the [Computer Chess Rating Lists](https://ccrl.chessdom.com/ccrl/). After a lot of hard work, I think (based on some experiments) MORA CHESS ENGINE is in the 2100-2200 range.

***UPDATE:** MORA CHESS ENGINE 1.0.0 is rated **2182 ELO** under [40 moves in 4 minutes time control](https://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/404/) and **2203** under [40 moves in 40 minutes](https://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/4040/). The new version 1.1.0 is almost the same but I would say that is probably 20 ELO points stronger.*

## Build
I've provided binaries for both Windows and Linux. Still, if you want to compile the sources yourself you can use g++ compiler with the following commands:

### Linux

```
g++ -std=c++11 -O3 -pthread attacks.cpp bitboards.cpp evaluation.cpp main.cpp move.cpp movegenerator.cpp pawnhashtable.cpp position.cpp search.cpp timemanagement.cpp transpositiontable.cpp uci.cpp -o MORA
```

### Windows

```
g++ -std=c++11 -O3 attacks.cpp bitboards.cpp evaluation.cpp main.cpp move.cpp movegenerator.cpp pawnhashtable.cpp position.cpp search.cpp timemanagement.cpp transpositiontable.cpp uci.cpp -o MORA
```

Notice the `-O3` flag to turn on all the optimizations of the compiler. 
## GUI

MORA CHESS ENGINE supports the UCI Protocol, so you can use any GUI that implements UCI to try the engine. 
I use [Arena Chess GUI](http://www.playwitharena.de/), which you can download for free.

In Arena you can install a new engine like this:

1. Go to **Engines/Install New Engine...**
2. Select the binary corresponding to your platform.
3. Go to **Engines/Manage...**
4. Select **UCI** where it says *type* (if it was not recognized from the beginning)
5. You should also go to **Books** in the previous menu and select the <*Use Arena mainbooks with this engine*> option (MCE doesn't implement its own opening book).

## Platforms

MORA CHESS ENGINE is available for both **Windows** and **Linux**. You can download the binaries from [here](https://github.com/gonzaloarro/MORA-CHESS-ENGINE/releases/latest).

**Note:** The sources are pretty much the same, but for the moment Windows's version doesn't implement *stop/quit* UCI commands to interrupt a search. In the future maybe I will add a cross platform thread library (like [Boost](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/doc/html/thread.html)) to unify both versions.
